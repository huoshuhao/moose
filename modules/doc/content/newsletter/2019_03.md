# MOOSE News (March 2019)

## MOOSEDocs LaTeX Support

Support for PDF output (via pdflatex) was added to MOOSEDocs, this capability includes support for
latex output to all MOOSEDocs extensions. This capability is still in the early stages of
development, but if you are ambitious and would like to test out the capability the following will
demonstrate the tool.

```bash
cd ~/projects/moose/test
make -j12
cd ~/projects/moose/python/MooseDocs/test
./moosedocs.py build --config latex.yml
open output/latex/main.pdf # MacOS only
```

## AD Vector Variable Coupling

Support was added to the automatic differentiation system in support of coupling to vector variables
via the `adCoupledVectorValue` and `adCoupledVectorGradient` functions within the ADKernel objects.

## AD Fluid Properties

Support was added to the fluid properties system for automatic differentiation - currently
SinglePhaseFluidProperties only.  To use it, call the appropriate functions while passing in
ADReal values - e.g.:

```c++
// assume rho is an AD nonlinear variable:
ADReal specific_vol = 1 / rho;

// assume rhoE, and rhou are AD nonlinear variables:
ADReal u = rhou/rho;
ADReal specific_internal_energy = rhoE / rho - u*u/2;
ADReal pressure = _fluid_prop_object.p_from_v_e(specific_vol, specific_internal_energy);
```

## AD Tensor Mechanics

Tensor mechanics stress divergence kernels for all coordinate systems were converted over to the
automatic differentiation system. In addition, AD versions for strain calculators for all coordinate
systems and all supported strain types (small, incremental small, and finite) were added (new object
name prefixed with `AD`). Initial AD support for inelastic models has been added, such as power law
creep. Creep and plasticity models with internal newton solves have particularly difficult to implement
Jacobians (which are currently often approximated by the elastic stiffness). AD improves these models
considerably by providing perfect Jacobians. In support of the AD Tensor
Mechanics additions, framework level calculation of the dependence of quadrature point
locations on mesh displacements was added. This is particularly important for
calculations in non-Cartesian geometries.

## Fluid Properties Interrogator

Users of the `fluid_properties` module now have a utility for sampling thermodynamic properties
at a specified state. This utility is valid for all fluid properties classes that derive from
`SinglePhaseFluidProperties` and `TwoPhaseFluidProperties`. A syntax is provided for specifying
the thermodynamic state at which to sample, and a number of properties are printed to the console
at this state. See the documentation of `FluidPropertiesInterrogator` for details.
